# [JoomGap Boilerplate](http://www.joomgap.com/)

A JoomGap starter project to create a hybrid mobile app for Joomla! CMS, powered by Cordova/PhoneGap, AngularJS and Ionic.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and
combined community knowledge from open source projects. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the
way that you want.
